🤖 Genetic Algorithm Path Optimization
Optimize robot navigation using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to find the shortest, obstacle-free path on a grid. This project combines AI optimization with real-time visualization of the robot’s journey.

🌟 Features
~ Optimized Pathfinding: Evolves paths over generations to reach the goal efficiently.
~ Obstacle Avoidance: Ensures the robot does not collide with obstacles.
~ Step Minimization: Optimizes for the fewest moves possible.
~ Real-Time Visualization: Highlights explored cells and the final path.
~ Early Stopping: GA halts when an optimal path is found.

🛠️ Requirements
~ Python 3.x
~ numpy
~ matplotlib
Install dependencies:
  pip install numpy matplotlib

 🚀 Usage
Run the main script:
   python ga_path.py
~ Console Output: Shows generation-wise fitness evolution.
~ Animation: Visualizes the robot moving along the optimized path with highlighted steps.
